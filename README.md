# Team-3 : Web3preneurs

<b>PROBLEM STATEMENT :</b>

   Have you ever bought something online, and then returned it back because either the size didn’t match, the product was damaged, or even worse, it wasn’t the product you were expecting? The benefits given on returning must seem appealing right? But did you know that you are increasing your carbon footprints by just returning a product you ordered?

   According to the National Retail Federation and Appriss Retail, an estimated $428 billion in retail merchandise was returned in 2020. Similar stats have been seen worldwide, especially after the boom of eCommerce post-Covid-19.
